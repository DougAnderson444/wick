# Wick documentation

Wick is an application runtime that allows you to stitch components together into web services, CLI apps, microservices, workers, anything. Wick was designed from the ground-up with **reusability** and **security** in mind. Wick is built with rust and WebAssembly to keep your code secure and portable.
